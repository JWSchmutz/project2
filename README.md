[This online app, Patient Link](https://patient-link.herokuapp.com/dashboard) was made to be used for computers only, and is not optomized for small screens.  We intended for it to only be used on a local hospital network.

The website is designed to allow hospitals and other health care facilities to quickly and easily access patient information, especially for patients who have not yet been to the facility.  This can remove wait times due to paper work, and will allow hospitals to get vital information, like blood type, in dire situations.  We even made patient cards with QR codes on them so patient information can be quickly accessed.

Facilities can add patients or doctors to the global database.  Doctors can be assigned to patients along with prescriptions and insurance.  Additionally, data is available to enable growth of a facility by comparing its speed and efficiency against national averages.
