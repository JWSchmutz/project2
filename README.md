[This online app, Patient Link](https://patient-link.herokuapp.com/dashboard) was optimised for desktop only, and is not meant for small screens. 

This application is designed to allow hospitals and other health care facilities to quickly and easily access patient information from a centralized database. This can remove wait times due to paper work, and allow hospitals to get vital information quickly if needed in dire situations. Patient Link also has routes built in for a QR code. 

Once logged into the application you can add patients and doctors to the database, search through existing database entries, and visit the analytics page by clicking the link in the bottom right corner. The analytics page uses data from the server to create a visual representation of key performance indicators of the facility using the application.
